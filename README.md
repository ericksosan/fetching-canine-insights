# Kennim's Dog Breed Project üêï

Meet Kennim, our customer. He's a wizard who's passionate about dogs and their sub-breeds. He has a new project in mind, and he's seeking your assistance to bring it to fruition. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Project Overview

Kennim seeks to weave a web tapestry showcasing the grandeur of dog breeds and their intricate sub-categories. Picture this: a realm where dog images and names grace the canvas, and the magic of hovering reveals all the sub-breeds.

But wait, there's more enchantment to be had! Behold, a table unveiling all dog breeds and their sub-categories, complete with the power to summon search and filter spells, custom-tailored for dog names and sub-breeds.

## Technical Stack

The technologies used for this project are **React**, **TypeScript (TS)**, and **CSS**.

## Features
